Answer:

I would follow the PMI way of categorizing the project management competencies - which fall under the three domains:

1) Business Domain Competencies
2) People Domain Competencies
3) Process Domain Competencies


Business Domain Competencies:

Business Domain competency expects the project manager to understand the domain in which he is operating, understanding the organizational strategy, understanding the user segment awareness, understanding the competition with other player in that particular area, understanding the Regulatory and Compliance Environment which might be in existance in that particular space, 

say like
As a project manager, I expect the project manager to understand the business domain well, a project manager may not be an expert in the business domain, but should have a fair understanding to support a stakeholder interaction, and negotiations related to the business domain area, that helps them in building right relationship and trust.


People domain competencies:

- Stakeholder Interaction
- Project team


As a project manager I should have a good competency to demonstrate and build trust with my stakeholders, Project Manager should build trust by way of keeping things transparent, by way of demonstrating emotional intelligence, by way of listening to the stakeholders, taking care of their concerns, keeping them updated, finally I should make them feel that they should trust me, that is one my major competency that I must have.


Another competency that I should focus on my with my stakeholder is - I should be able to mentor, coach and train my stakeholders - so that they can make best use of the project deliverables, 

Another competency is that - I should be able to manage changes, and facilitate the changes to the stakeholder, by training, or coaching them, and mentoring them to adapt to the new change.

Another competency is - communication - I should have good listening skills, so that I have to show that I have a bidirectional communication channel - with the stakeholders.


Project Team members:

My project team is doing all the work, they are the one who are delivering the work, hence it is very important to 
Create a healthy environment for my team, I should be able to facilitate discussions amongst them, create right team environment, should be able to create trust amongst the team members, and create good communication channel amongst the team members, so they are not dependent on me, so they are self organized 

Ability to build team,
healthy relationship between team members
take care of conflicts,
resolve impediments
take care of confusions related to roles and responsibilities
make sure the team has a clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities and their working agreement


Team development:
- I should be investing my time to give feedback to the individual team members within the team, help them grow professionally, set up goals, help them developing their soft skills, help them in developing their technical skills, overall - by doing all these I influence the motivation of the team, and help build a great team.

- I also bring into consideration that I am working with mulitple people in the team in different places, as they are all remote, and also with different cultures and different values.
