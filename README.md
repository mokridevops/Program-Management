Tell me about the top competencies of the project managers or
Tell me the key skills the project manager should have


Answer:

I would follow the PMI way of categorizing the project management competencies - which fall under the three domains:

1) Business Domain Competencies
2) People Domain Competencies
3) Process Domain Competencies


Business Domain Competencies:

Business Domain competency expects the project manager to understand the domain in which he is operating, understanding the organizational strategy, understanding the user segment awareness, understanding the competition with other player in that particular area, understanding the Regulatory and Compliance Environment which might be in existance in that particular space, 

say like
As a project manager, I expect the project manager to understand the business domain well, a project manager may not be an expert in the business domain, but should have a fair understanding to support a stakeholder interaction, and negotiations related to the business domain area, that helps them in building right relationship and trust.


People domain competencies:

- Stakeholder Interaction
- Project team


As a project manager I should have a good competency to demonstrate and build trust with my stakeholders, Project Manager should build trust by way of keeping things transparent, by way of demonstrating emotional intelligence, by way of listening to the stakeholders, taking care of their concerns, keeping them updated, finally I should make them feel that they should trust me, that is one my major competency that I must have.


Another competency that I should focus on my with my stakeholder is - I should be able to mentor, coach and train my stakeholders - so that they can make best use of the project deliverables, 

Another competency is that - I should be able to manage changes, and facilitate the changes to the stakeholder, by training, or coaching them, and mentoring them to adapt to the new change.
